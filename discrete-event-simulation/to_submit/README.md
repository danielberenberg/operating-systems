# Discrete Event Simulation
## Compile instructions
- Make sure you have a Python 3 installation on your computer
- Place `simulator.py`, `desutils.py`, and `reinforcement.py` in the same directory.
- The simulator can be run using `python simulator.py <params>` where the
`params` are the command line parameters supported by the application as specified in the assignment.
- You can specify the parameter `-q -3` to `simulator.py` to invoke reinforcement learning based adaptive
preemption.
- `batch_simulate.sh` was used to to batch simulations for results in the writeup.
